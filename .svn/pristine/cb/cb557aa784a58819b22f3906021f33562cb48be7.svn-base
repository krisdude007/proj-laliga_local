    4. Youtoo Accounts
</p>
<p>
    Youtoo reserves the right to close or freeze Participant’s account at any time for any reason. For example, Youtoo may close or freeze Participant’s
    account, void all activity on duplicate accounts, and/or reclaim any prize(s) won where any of the following have occurred: Youtoo’s verification process
    identifies additional accounts opened by Participant or indicates that Participant is in a jurisdiction (or is a citizen of a jurisdiction) that makes the
    provision of Youtoo’s products or services to Participant or the use of them illegal; Youtoo’s service to Participant has previously been permanently
    terminated; Participant’s activity or gameplay attempts to bypass Youtoo’s system controls; Youtoo suspects that Illegal Activity (as defined below) has
    occurred; Participants has breached the terms of these Official Rules. Deliberate attempts to falsify account details may lead to the closure of ALL
    related Youtoo accounts. As part of the registration verification process, Youtoo may make use of third parties, which will consist of credit card or
    financial providers to confirm Participant’s identity and any necessary details. By creating a Youtoo account, Participant agrees that Youtoo may use,
    record and disclose Participant’s personal information to third parties and this data may be recorded by such parties. As a condition of opening a Youtoo
    account, Participant acknowledges that Youtoo may verify Participant’s age. If Youtoo is unable to verify Participant’s identity or if Participant is
    ultimately shown to be underage, Youtoo, within a reasonable time, may close Participant’s account and/or restrict entry, and Participant will forfeit any
    payments or prizes won but not yet awarded.
</p>
<p>
    Youtoo may freeze or close Participant’s account when requested to do so by a governmental authority or judicial process. If requested, Youtoo may also
    supply the governmental authority or court with personal information about Participant.
</p>
<p>
    Illegal Activity includes, but is not limited to: money laundering, including where there is a link to terrorist funding; and involvement in collusion,
    match rigging or cheating of any kind.
</p>
<p>
    5. Intellectual Property
</p>
<p>
    Participant acknowledges and agrees that all intellectual property, including without limitation any trademarks, logos and trade names; domain names;
    website material (including without limitation design, text, graphics, sound, video, underlying source code and software); database rights and all related
    software, shall at all times remain vested in the Sponsor, Software Provider, their respective licensees, or the third party licensor of the intellectual
    property, as applicable. If any intellectual property from a Youtoo account is downloadable or can be printed, then such material can only be downloaded to
    a single personal computer and hard copies may only be printed for Participant’s personal and non-commercial use. No right, title or interest in any
    downloaded materials or software is transferred to Participant by downloading. Participant may not transfer, copy, reproduce, distribute, exploit or make
    any other use of intellectual property obtained from his or her Youtoo account other than to display such intellectual property on his or her computer
    screen or to view the intellectual property on a print-out. The Youtoo account may not be linked to any other website without written permission from
    Youtoo.

    6. Youtoo Credits
    <br/>
    Youtoo may offer users the ability to earn or purchase Youtoo credits (“Credits”) which users can redeem for upgraded services, merchandise, or other
    products or services (collectively, the “Rewards”) on the Youtoo Service (“Credits Program”). The accumulation of Credits is subject to the Credits Program
    Rules. Each user is responsible for reading the Credits Program Rules and other documents, which are provided in order to understand the structure for
    earning or purchasing Credits as well as their rights, responsibilities, and status with respect to the Credits. Youtoo retains the right to change, limit,
    modify, or cancel the Credits Program at their discretion, with or without notice. This means that the accumulation of Credits does not entitle you to any
    vested rights with respect to such Credits, Rewards or Credits Program benefits. In accumulating Credits, you may not rely upon the continued availability
    of any Reward or Reward level, and you may not be able to obtain all offered Rewards. The number of Credits required to redeem any Reward, may be
    substantially increased, any Reward may be withdrawn, and restrictions on any Reward may be imposed at any time. The purchase price for Credits may be
    changed at any time at Youtoo’s discretion. All Credits, whether earned or purchased, are not owned by the user. Rather, you have a limited right to use
    the Credits for Rewards within the Youtoo Service. Credits have no monetary value and cannot be redeemed for any sum of money. Purchases of credits are
    non-refundable. You agree that you will not sell, barter, or otherwise transfer your Credits. Any Credits so exchanged are void if transferred for cash or
    other consideration. Youtoo reserves the right to audit any and all accounts at any time and without notice to the user to ensure compliance with Youtoo’s
    Terms and the Credits Program Rules. In the event that an audit reveals discrepancies or violations, you may be prohibited from earning, purchasing, or
    redeeming Credits as determined in Youtoo’s sole discretion.
