</p>
<p>

    to qualify them to enter into the draw in order to win prizes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Qualifying Entrants</strong>

    <strong>Regulations of participation in the Sweepstakes:</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Once the participant enters the Sweepstakes on the website, User/Participant will be able to answer a question and 4 possible answers (one answer is
    correct and the other three are wrong). The participant answers the question by clicking on their choice of a correct answer’s “Radio Button”. A
    participant can play as many as ten (10) times in a day. The more correct entries by a player could potentially increase their probability to win.
</p>
<p>
    For each correct answer to the question, the participant receives 1 entry into a drawing for the prize. All players receive credits for the store for
    playing. Credits are on a 1 to 1 ratio. Current price to play is one (1) dollar; so players receive 1 credit for the store for each entry. Wrong/Invalid
