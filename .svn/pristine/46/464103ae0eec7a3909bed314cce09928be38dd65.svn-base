    <strong>What are the questions</strong>
    <strong> like? Can I play more than once?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Each week will have a different multiple-choice question based upon Baldini’s, which is the first game. The questions are skill based. Players will have to
    select one answer from the two multiple-choice answers offered. The next game, Game 2, also costs $1 (one US dollar) to play, but will consist of three (3)
    questions. These questions are trivia based and will have four (4) possible answers each. You will have 15 seconds to answer each question. Each correct
    response creates one additional Sweepstakes entry for the participant. The next game, Game 3 through Game 10, each costs $1 (one US dollar) to play, but
    will consist of five (5) questions. Players can pay to play a maximum of $10 (ten US dollars) per day.
